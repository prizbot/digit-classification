# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing machine learning models for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It starts by visualizing sample images from the dataset, providing an overview of the data. Four classification models are implemented:

1) **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**: Utilizes the KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn, achieving an accuracy of approximately 94.04%.
2) **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Implements SVC with a linear kernel, achieving a similar accuracy of around 94.04%.
3) **Random Forest (RF)**: Utilizes RandomForestClassifier with 100 estimators, achieving an accuracy of approximately 97.00%.
4) **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Implements a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving the highest accuracy of approximately 99.07% after training for 5 epochs.

The project concludes with a model comparison using a bar plot to visualize the accuracies achieved by each model. It demonstrates the process of training and evaluating machine learning models for image classification tasks, providing insights into their performance differences.

## Usage
To use the project, ensure you have the required libraries installed and run the provided code snippets to load the dataset, train the models, and evaluate their accuracies. Experimentation with hyperparameters or model architectures can further enhance performance.
